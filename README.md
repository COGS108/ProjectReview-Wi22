# ProjectReview-Wi22
This repo contains a small set of previous projects which will be reviewed by current students.

You will be reviewing two projects.  One of them will be a high quality project, one a low quality project.  

I'm not going to tell you which is which. Ask yourself that question, and see if you can articulate why.

NB: Even the low quality reports have good points, and the high quality reports have flaws.

## Instructions - DO THIS AS A GROUP!! Do not do this individually.
1. Select one of the three projects from PROJECT_A (randomly, or based on your interests, doesn't matter)
2. Select one of the three projects from PROJECT_B (as above)
3. Each person in the group should read the two selected projects
4. As a group, talk about what you saw as the positive and negative aspects of each report
5. Agree on a short summary of what each report did (make a ~32 word abstract of the problem and results)
6. Think in each case what (if anything) from this report would you like to do similarly in your report (methods, report writing, kind of topics, whatever)
7. Think also about what (if anything) from this report would you like to avoid in your report
8. Agree on a "grade" for each report
9. Record your groups reactions at https://forms.gle/Uom6cSvMgSWak9uQ6

## Things to think about
- Is the question interesting or does it seem like they just asked something random they happened to have data for?
- Is the question/hypothesis clear, could someone misinterpret the words?
- Is the data interesting? Do you know exactly what the data are from the description, or are there unexplained jargon terms?
- Was it easy or hard for them to get the data to answer the question? Was there a lot of work involved in cleaning up the data?
- Are the analyses presented in a way that you understand? Is math explained?
- If you happen to be able to spot technical problems (misused analyses) that's great, but don't worry about it if you cant
- Are visualizations clear? Think of whether you know what a measurement is, if axes are labelled, if things are printed too small to make out, etc.
- Are there conclusions? Do you believe them? Is the conclusion of interest to you or just *yawn*?
- Did the groups members work well together, or is there evidence of problems?
