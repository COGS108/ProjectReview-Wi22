8. Agree on a "grade" for each report
9. Record your groups reactions at https://forms.gle/Uom6cSvMgSWak9uQ6

## Things to think about
- Is the question interesting or does it seem like they just asked something random they happened to have data for?
- Is the question/hypothesis clear, could someone misinterpret the words?
- Is the data interesting? Do you know exactly what the data are from teh description, or are there unexplained jargon terms?
- Was it easy or hard for them to get the data to answer the question? Was there a lot of work involved in cleaning up the data?
- Are the analyses presented in a way that you understand? Is math explained?
- Are there conclusions? Do you believe them? Is the conclusion of interest to you or just *yawn*?
